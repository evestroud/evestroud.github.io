# Hi, I'm Eve!

## Introduction

I'm a software engineer, trained at Ada Developer's Academy and currently
interning with SAP Concur! I'm passionate about programming, especially
functional programming and type systems.

This page is still a work in progress since I've been more focused on my
internship and getting my portfolio projects presentable but I hope to polish it
up soon!
